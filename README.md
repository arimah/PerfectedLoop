# PerfectedLoop

This mod makes [Perfected elites][perfected] spawn in the game after [looping][]. This elite type normally only spawns on the Moon. Perfected elites will spawn under the same conditions as Malachite and Celestine elites. As a result, Perfected, Malachite and Celestine elites will be approximately evenly distributed once they start appearing.

In addition, Perfected elites will very occasionally drop [Shared Design][] when killed.

Perfected elites continue to spawn on the Moon.

**Network compatibility:** In multiplayer, only the host needs the mod.
